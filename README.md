# Genetic-Algorithm-Bin-Packing
## Genetic algorithm for the bin packing NP problem in Python  
The algorithm works similar to the genetic algorithm in the "load balancing" problem.  
initialize a population of genes by randomization which item goes to which bin.  
calculate evaluation of genes by some function, set appropriate probabilities and start randomazing & building the next generation.  
The B&B algorithm for bin packing works better for smaller inputs (in run-time and result efficiency), but this algorithm returns faster solution (although not precisely good solution) for very large inputs.
